Installation Instructions:

Install pianobar

Put desired pianobar config at ~/.config/pianobar/pbctl_config
do not include fifo path or eventcmd
PbCtl will automatically create a config file at ~/.config/pianobar/config that includes the contents of pbctl_config and the necessary fifo path and eventcommand that pbctl requires to function

Installing onto raspberry pi with arch linux

install RVM (see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/RVM)
	install git, curl, and sudo
	run 'curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable'
	add '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"' to your ~/.bashrc file
	run 'exec bash'
install sudo and add your user to the sudoers file (at least while you are installing ruby)
	instead of installing sudo, you may be able to use 'rvm notes' and 'rvm requirements' to see what you need to install
run 'rvm install ruby'
	This will take a *very* long time (over 2 hours) on the raspberry pi since it has to compile ruby
from the pbctl directory, run 'bundle install' and 'bundle update'
install nodejs
currently you may need to comment out the Station.delete_all line from config/initializers/start_pianobar.rb
from the pbctl directory, run 'bundle exec rake db:reset' and 'bundle exec rake db:migrate'
run 'rails server' and you're up and running


Note:

It may not work if you put it on a filesystem path that has whitespace in it

Bugs:
Currently this only works on port 3000 since the eventcommand script
is hardcoded to submit to localhost:3000/popfile

When clicking any action on the header bar, it will redirect to the song list


Icons were obtained from http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/downloads.html some of the tango icons that are under
the public domain are in use in this application.

Done:

Add header
	links for play, skip, like, dislike, station list, song details
	show title, artist, album, and cover art
	make sure to indicate if a song has been liked or disliked (I think the rating line will indicate this)

Start pianobar on server start
	  Use custom config for eventscript and fifo

Allow programmatic update of status and stations
	  There is an authentication token issue when posting the status text via command line

Reverse order of songs in song index

Put onto raspberry pi
	Add info in readme about what needs to be installed on the raspberry pi
	(for arch linux installation, and for raspbian installation)

TODO:
	
Add unit tests

Later TODO:

Add footer
	links for github page, readme, about, etc.
