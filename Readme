Installation Instructions:

Install pianobar

Put desired pianobar config at ~/.config/pianobar/pbctl_config
do not include fifo path or eventcmd
PbCtl will automatically create a config file at ~/.config/pianobar/config
that includes the contents of pbctl_config and the necessary fifo path and eventcommand
that pbctl requires to function

Bugs:
Currently this only works on port 3000 since the eventcommand script
is hardcoded to submit to localhost:3000/popfile

When clicking any action on the header bar, it will redirect to the song list

Done:

Add header
	links for play, skip, like, dislike, station list, song details
	show title, artist, album, and cover art
	make sure to indicate if a song has been liked or disliked (I think the rating line will indicate this)

Start pianobar on server start
	  Use custom config for eventscript and fifo

Allow programmatic update of status and stations
	  There is an authentication token issue when posting the status text via command line

Reverse order of songs in song index

TODO:


Put onto raspberry pi
	Add info in readme about what needs to be installed on the raspberry pi
	(for arch linux installation, and for raspbian installation)
	
Add unit tests

Later TODO:

Add footer
	links for github page, readme, about, etc.
